# Development-of-Path-Planning-Algorithm-using-PSO-Bezier-Curve-A-for-Omni-wheeled-robot
This work optimizes motion planning for a omni-directional robot in a grid-based environment. A* generates an initial obstacle-free path, BÃ©zier curves smoothen the trajectory, and PSO optimizes control points and velocity profiles to minimize travel time and enhance maneuverability.
